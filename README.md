# Prodzilla ðŸ¦–

Prodzilla is a modern synthetic monitoring tool built in Rust. It's focused on surfacing whether existing behaviour in production is as expected in a human-readable format, so that even customers or stakeholders can contribute to system verification. 

A SaaS option will be available soon. More at [prodzilla.io](https://prodzilla.io/).

It's currently in active development.

## Usage

The application parses the `prodzilla.yml` file to generate a list of probes executed on a given schedule.

The yml file will represent a view of the intended behaviour of the services that any human / stakeholder can read and understand.

A full view of this is available in `prodzilla-future.yml`.

```yml
stories:
  - name: Create cardholder card
    steps:
      - name: Create cardholder
        as: CardholderUser
        url: https://api.cardwebsite.com/cardholders/create
        http_method: POST
        with: CreateCardholderRequest
        expect_back: ValidCreateCardholderResponse

      - name: Create card
        as: CardholderUser
        url: https://api.cardwebsite.com/cards/create
        http_method: POST
        with: CreateCardRequest
        expect_back: ValidCreateCardResponse

      - name: Get card in Admin panel

        http_method: POST
